Please fork this repository into your private Github account to develop your solution.

## Summary

- Task implies building a simple React app with two screens: an **items list** and an **item details** dashboard.
- There is a mock data source, however it is built partly with real data.
- The user can browse items list, can filter it, can open dashboard for specific item and can make changes to an item.
- Changes applied should be stored in data source and reflected in the list.
- Your application should manage data source from 25 dogs.
- Data source contains a mix of real and fake data.
- Initially dog name and description are randomly generated.
- Dog's breed and sub-breed are real, use provided Dogs API, just pick random breeds to build your data source.
- Dog’s picture is real, use provided Dogs API, pick random one for specific breed.
